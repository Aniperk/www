Hello NetherGames players!

We're happy to announce that we have moved to a new applications system, which uses Google Forms!

We have reopened the much-awaited Builder applications as well. For those who are interested in this and any of our other positions (Forums Moderator, Discord Moderator, Trainee, Support Representative), you may apply at https://ngmc.co/t.

Please note that you will not receive any response unless you are accepted.

We will not be closing applications once positions are filled - they are here to stay.

Good luck to all future applicants!
