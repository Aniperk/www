Hello NetherGames players!

We've pushed out a huge update to Infection Mode on our Murder Mystery servers!

Here’s what's new:

- The Alpha Infected (the first player to be infected) looks like any other survivor until they’re killed. They'll have a fake bow to trick other survivors, so beware! The Alpha Infected also has 2 lives (once they're dead infected players can no longer respawn) and they can throw their weapon every 15 seconds.

- Normal infected players can throw their sword once they have collected 10 gold and no longer have jump boost

- Survivors now spawn with 16 arrows instead of 64 and can collect 6 gold for an additional 24 arrows

If you have any questions, feel free to contact our support team via the live chat button located at the bottom right corner of your screen, through email - support@nethergames.org, or through Twitter - @NetherGamesMC.

Enjoy the new update!
