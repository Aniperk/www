Hello NetherGames players!

We're pleased to announce that a new update has been released and is now live across the network!

This update brings the long-awaited cosmetics, including trails, arrow trails, kill effects and win effects. Right now, there are only a limited number of cosmetics up for grabs, however this list should expand as time goes on.

You can earn keys by playing a game - once you've won, you have a 1 in 5 chance of getting a key to unlock a crate in the lobby. Crate keys will also be available on our store very soon.

On top of cosmetics, this update also brings a number of bug fixes and team chat for Bedwars and SkyWars.

If you find any bugs with the new update, please report them to #bugs on our Discord server (ngmc.co/d) or send them to our support team - ngmc.co/lc or email support@nethergames.org.

Enjoy!
